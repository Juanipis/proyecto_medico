# Medical Flutter Project

Welcome to the Medical Flutter Project, a part of our third subject project. In this assignment, we're tasked with developing a clone of a medical app.

## Getting Started with Development using Docker

Follow these steps to set up your development environment using Docker:

1. **Install Docker:** Make sure you have Docker installed on your system.

2. **Install VSCode:** If you haven't already, install Visual Studio Code, a powerful code editor.

3. **Install Dev Containers Extension:** In VSCode, install the "Remote - Containers" extension. This will allow you to work seamlessly within a containerized environment.

4. **Build the Docker Container:**
   - Launch VSCode.
   - Open the project folder.
   - Run the "Build Flutter container for development" task. This will create a Docker container configured for Flutter development.

5. **Run the Docker Container:**
   - Run the "Run Flutter container for development" task. This will start the Docker container.

6. **Attach to the Running Container:**
   - Utilize the Dev Containers extension to "Attach to running container."
   - This will open a new VSCode window within the containerized environment.

7. **Open the Project:**
   - Once attached to the container, navigate to the `/flutter/` folder within the new VSCode window.

8. **Install Flutter Extension:**
   - Install the Flutter extension within the containerized VSCode instance.

9. **Run Flutter Doctor:**
   - Open the integrated terminal in VSCode and execute `flutter doctor` to ensure everything is set up correctly.

10. **Run the App:**
    - In the VSCode debug section, choose "Flutter Web Server (Debug) for docker container" and start debugging.

11. **Setup Dart Debug Extension:**
    - Install the [Dart Debug Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dart-debug-extension/eljbmlghnomdjgdjmbdekegdkbabckhm) in a Chromium-based browser.

12. **Access the App:**
    - In your browser, navigate to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to interact with the running app.
13. **Optional:**
    - If you dont want to have to vscode open to run the app, you can run the following command in the terminal to docker run -it --rm --name flutter-develop-container -v path-to/flutter flutter-dev to run the container
